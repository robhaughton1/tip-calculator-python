# Tip Calculator (Python)

A simple Python script that calculates the tip amount and total bill based on user input. This project demonstrates basic input handling, arithmetic operations, and formatted output in a clean and readable structure.

## How It Works
The program prompts the user for:
- The bill amount
- The tip percentage

It then calculates:
- The tip amount
- The final total after adding the tip

All values are rounded to two decimal places for clarity.

## Example Interaction
The script runs in the terminal. A typical session looks like:

Bill Amount: 50  
Tip Percentage: 20  
Tip Amount: 10.0  
Total Amount: 60.0  

## Purpose
This project was created to practice writing simple Python scripts that interact with user input and perform basic calculations. It serves as a foundational example of clean scripting and formatted output.

## Improvements Made
- Cleaned and organized the code for readability
- Ensured proper rounding of numerical output
- Added clear variable names for maintainability
- Structured the script for easy modification or expansion

## What I Learned
- Handling user input in Python
- Performing arithmetic operations
- Formatting numerical output
- Writing clear and readable Python code

## Tech Used
- Python 3  
- Git and GitHub
