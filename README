# Tip & Total Calculator (Python)

A beginner-friendly Python program that calculates the final cost of a meal based on a user-provided tip percentage and meal costs.

## What it does
- Asks the user for the meal price
- Asks for the tip percentage
- Calculates the tip amount
- Adds the tip to the meal price
- Rounds the final total to two decimal places

## What I practiced
- Input handling
- Arithmetic logic
- Rounding values
- Writing clean, readable code
- Debugging and correcting logic errors

## Why I built it
This was my first résumé-worthy Python project. I wanted something small, practical, and fully understood, not copied. It helped me build confidence in writing and explaining my own code.
